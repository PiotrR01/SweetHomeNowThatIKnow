      <h1> About Us </h1>
        <p>To meet Monika is to be inspired by the story of her origin in Poland, her home country. Starting with catering college, it was then that she developed her passion for making beautiful cakes. As she tell me, she loves beautiful things! </p>
        <p>Her first job following college was in the five-star Amber Baltic hotel. With her undoubted skills, she soon became restaurante manager and progressed on to other well-known hotels. She eventually decided to move to Dublin in Ireland with her children and soon was itching to start her own business, Monika's Catering in 2006. Sadly, like so many other companies during COVID, she was forced to closed.</p>
        <p>Not to be detterred, Monika decided to come to Lagos to help her friend Marzena, who had just had a baby. She has decided to take over the business. So she has achivied her goal of running her own cake shop and cafe.</p>
        <p>It is a lovely cafe, well located in a pedestrian-only street near Pdm-travel, where you can relax outside with a coffee and of course, one or more of her delicious cakes. I tried the absolutely delightful spinach cake!</p>                 <p>She offers vegan and gluten-free options, so no one needs to miss out!</p>
        <p>A realy lovely cafe and a lovely happy and cheerful hostess. I realy do recommend a visit to find sweet home away from home!</p>
